# dotfiles

[![CI](https://github.com/brcrista/dotfiles/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brcrista/dotfiles/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is my repository of configuration files.

## Installation

```sh
# This should work on any Linux or macOS system.
./bootstrap
```

### Other setup (macOS)

Install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html). Besides getting you LaTeX, this also lets you render Markdown as PDF with [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/).

The files for VS Code and iTerm2 must be copied manually.
