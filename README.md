# dotfiles

![CI](https://github.com/brcrista/dotfiles/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is my repository of configuration files.

## Installation

```sh
# This should work on any Linux or macOS system.
./install.sh
```

Then, if on macOS, run:

```sh
./macos.sh
```

Files that are not platform-agnostic must be copied manually.
